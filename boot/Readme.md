# Boot files

Replace the original boot file files by this ones if you face some issue  
with boot and Uart.
Take care the PARTUID must be the right one ...

The cmdline.txt file delete access to "console 0" because this one is  
used for UART with Linky.

The config.txt file add support for Uart and I2C.
